This is a simple Popup Module to display any message in a popup window.


To use this module perform the following steps:

    -Download all the files.
    -Create a folder named "Popup" in app/code directory.
    -Inside the "Popup" folder create another folder named "ModalOverlay".
    -Paste the downloaded files in the "ModalOverlay" folder.
    -Now you need to create a static block from magento admin panel named "popup-content" and block identifier will also be "popup-content".

Thats it, the static block will be displayed in a popup window now on the homepage. You can customize your block in any way you like.
